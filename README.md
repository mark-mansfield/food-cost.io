# food-cost.io

An Angular CRUD SPA built for my chef buddies that allows them to create , and cost food menus.

# What I Learned

* Developed a user interface with several screens that are responsive using Material UI
* Implemented functionality to the UI: Login | Sign up (Authentication,Authorization), costing, ingredients CRUD, menus CRUD, ingredients CRUD, bulk ingredients import
* Implemented functionality to the Backend: a complete set of node.js API endpoints that query a mongo db database
